Notes on development-loop for this project
==========================================

- Keep two shells available in VSCode
    a) Python Debug Console for the Python Streamlit test project
    b) zsh for running the development server and re-building ts-code

Typescript development iteration (zsh)
--------------------------------------
- project_root: /Volumes/Work/development/projects/git/streamlit-lightweight-charts-v5/
- cd {project_root}/lightweight_charts_v5/frontend
- use restart.sh to re-build all ts-code and restart the server 
  (basically: npm run build && sleep 3 && npm start)

Python-side streamlit demo_chart.py
----------------------------------- 
- cd {project_root}
- stop streamlit debugger if running
- pip install -e .
- Cmd-Shift D to run streamlit again in the debugger

New Release
----------------
# Remove previous build artifacts
rm -rf build/ dist/ *.egg-info/

# Build the frontend
cd lightweight_charts_v5/frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ../..

# Build the Python package
python -m pip install --upgrade build
python -m build
